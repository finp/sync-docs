= Data Sync Framework

The {ProductShortName} mobile data synchronization framework includes the following features:

* Allows mobile apps to use and update data offline (local cache)
* Provides a mechanism to manage bi-directional data synchronization from multiple Client Apps using the Cloud App and into back-end data stores
* Allows data updates (that is, deltas) to be distributed from the Cloud App to connected clients
* Enables data collision management from multiple updates in the cloud
* Allows {ProductShortName} Apps to seamlessly continue working when the network connection is lost, and allows them to recover when the network connection is restored.

[[high-level-architecture]]
== High Level Architecture

image:sync_architecture.png[sync_architecture]

The Sync Framework comprises a set of Client App and Node.js Cloud App APIs.

The Client App does not access the back-end data directly.
Instead, it uses the Sync Client API to Read and List the data stored on the device and send changes (Creates, Updates, and Deletes) to the Cloud App.
Changes made to the data locally are stored in the local Sync Data Cache before being sent to the Cloud App.
The Client App receives notifications of changes to the remote dataset from the Sync Client API.

The Client App then uses the Client Sync Service to receive the changes (deltas) made to the remote dataset from the Cloud App and stores them in the Sync Data Cache. The Client App also sends Updates made locally to the Cloud App using the Client Sync Service.
When the Client App is off-line, cached updates are flushed to local storage on the device, allowing the changes to persist in case the Client App is closed before network connection is re-established.
The changes are pushed to the Cloud App the next time the Client App goes online.

The Cloud App does not access the Back End data directly, but only through the Sync Cloud API.
The Cloud App Uses the Sync Cloud API to receive updates from the Client App using the Client Sync Service.
These updates are stored in the Cloud App Sync Data Cache.
The Cloud App uses the Sync Cloud API to manage the Back End data in hosted storage using standard CRUDL (create, read, update, delete and list) and `collisionHandler` functions.

In addition to the standard data handler functions, the Cloud App can also employ user-defined data access functions.

[[basic-usage]]
== Getting Started

Follow these steps to implement the Sync framework in your App:


. Init $fh.sync on the client side
+
[source,javascript]
----
  //See [JavaScript SDK API](../api/app_api.html#app_api-_fh_sync) for the details of the APIs used here

  var datasetId = "myShoppingList";

  //provide sync init options
  $fh.sync.init({
    "sync_frequency": 10,
    "do_console_log": true,
    "storage_strategy": "dom"
  });

  //provide listeners for notifications.
  $fh.sync.notify(function(notification){
    var code = notification.code
    if('sync_complete' === code){
      //a sync loop completed successfully, list the update data
      $fh.sync.doList(datasetId,
        function (res) {
          console.log('Successful result from list:', JSON.stringify(res));
          },
        function (err) {
          console.log('Error result from list:', JSON.stringify(err));
        });
    } else {
      //choose other notifications the app is interested in and provide callbacks
    }
  });

  //manage the data set, repeat this if the app needs to manage multiple datasets
  var query_params = {}; //or something like this: {"eq": {"field1": "value"}}
  var meta_data = {};
  $fh.sync.manage(datasetId, {}, query_params, meta_data, function(){

  });
----

.About Notifications
The Sync framework emits different types of notifications during the sync life cycle. Depending on your app's requirements, you can choose which type of notifications your app  listens to and add callbacks. However, it's not mandatory, the Sync framework performs synchronization without notification listeners.
+
Adding appropriate notification listeners helps improve the user experience of your app:

* Show critical error messages to the user in situations where Sync framework errors occur. For example, `client_storage_failed`.
* Log errors and failures to the console to help debugging. For example, `remote_update_failed`, `sync_failed`.
* Update the UI related to the sync data if delta is received, for example, there are changes to the data, you can use `delta_received`, `record_delta_received`.
* Monitor for collisions. 
+
Make sure to use $fh.sync APIs to perform CRUDL operations on the client.

. Init $fh.sync on the cloud side
+
Call the init function in your Cloud App (for example, on app start):
+
[source,javascript]
----
var fhapi = require("fh-mbaas-api");
var datasetId = "myShoppingList";

var options = {
  "syncFrequency": 10
};

fhapi.sync.init(datasetId, options, function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log('sync inited');
  }
});
----
+
You can now use the Sync framework in your app, or use the sample app to explore the basic usage: https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/sync-app[Client App^] and https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/sync-cloud[Cloud App^].
+
If the default data access implementations do not meet your requirements, you can provide override functions.

[[advanced-usage]]
== Advanced Usage

The Sync Framework provides hooks to allow the App Developer to define how and where the source data for a dataset comes from. Often, the source data is an external database (MySql, Oracle, MongoDB etc), but this is not a requirement. The source data for a dataset could be anything - csv files, FTP meta data, or even data pulled from multiple database tables. The only requirement that the Sync Framework imposes is that each record in the source data have a unique Id and that the data is provided to the Sync Framework as a JSON Object.

In order to synchronize with the back end data source, the App developer can implement code for this synchronization.

For example, when listing data from back end, instead of loading data from database, you want to return hard coded data. Here are the steps:

. Init $fh.sync on the client side
+
This is the same as Step 1 in xref:basic-usage[Getting Started].

. Init $fh.sync on the cloud side and provide overrides.
+
[source,javascript]
----
var fhapi = require("fh-mbaas-api");
var datasetId = "myShoppingList";

var options = {
  "syncFrequency": 10
};

//provide hard coded data list
var datalistHandler = function(dataset_id, query_params, cb, meta_data){
  var data = {
    '00001': {
      'item': 'item1'
    },
    '00002': {
      'item': 'item2'
    },
    '00003': {
      'item': 'item3'
    }
  }
  return cb(null, data);
}

fhapi.sync.init(datasetId, options, function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    $fh.sync.handleList(datasetId, datalistHandler);
  }
});

Check the link:{CloudAPI}#fh-sync[Node.js API] Sync section for information about how to provide more overrides.

[[further-reading]]
== Further Reading

If you are interested, here is more information to help you understand the Sync framework.

[[datasets]]
=== Datasets

A dataset is a JSON Object which represents data to be synchronized between the App Client and App Cloud. The structure of a Dataset is:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  record_uid_1 : {<JSON Object of data>},
  record_uid_2 : {<JSON Object of data>},
  record_uid_3 : {<JSON Object of data>},
  ...
}
----

Each record in a dataset must have a unique identifier (UID). This UID is used as the key for the record in the dataset.

The Sync Framework can manage multiple datasets - each of which can be configured independently.

Each Dataset has a unique name which must be used when communicating with the Sync APIs (both in the App Client and App Cloud).

[[collisions]]
=== Collisions

A collision occurs when a client attempts to send an update to a record, but the client's version of the record is out of date. Typically, this happens when a client is off line and performs an update to a local version of a record.

Use the following handlers to deal with collisions:

* `handleCollision()` - Called by the Sync Framework when a collision occurs. The default implementation saves the data records to a collection named "<dataset_id>_collision".
* `listCollision()` - Returns a list of data collisions. The default implementation lists all the collision records from the collection name "<dataset_id>_collision".
* `removeCollision()` - Removes a collision record from the list of collisions. The default implementation deletes the collision records based on hash values from the collection named "<dataset_id>_collision".

You can provide the handler function overrides for dealing with data collisions. Options include:

* Store the collision record for manual resolution by a data administrator at a later date.
* Discard the update which caused the collision. To achieve this, the `handleCollision()` function would simply not do anything with the collision record passed to it. WARNING - this may result in data loss as the update which caused the collision would be discarded by the Cloud App.
* Apply the update which caused the collision. To achieve this, the `handleCollision()` function would need to call the `handleCreate()` function defined for the dataset.
+
WARNING: This may result in data loss as the update which caused the collision is based on a stale version of the data and could revert some fields to old values.
+
The native sync clients are similar interfaces. You can check the API and example codes in our https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-ios-sdk[iOS Github repo^] and https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-android-sdk[Android Github repo^].


[[avoid-collisions]]
==== Troubleshooting Unexpected Collisions

You may encounter collisions that are not expected. Possible causes include:

* There are auto updated fields in the records. For example, some ORM frameworks add fields like 'lastModified' to track the last update time of records.
The values for these fields change every time the data is saved in the Backend Database.
+
However, clients could submit more changes before downloading the updated field changes.
Those changes cause collisions because they do not have the latest timestamp.
* The records contain fields that are not valid JSON fields. 
For example, if the records returned from the `listHandler` contain fields that are `Date` objects, when they are being stringified, they could produce different value based on the timezone setting and cause collisions as well.

To avoid those types of collisions:

* Do not return the auto updated fields in the results from the `listHandler`
* Make sure valid JSON data is returned from the `listHandler`
* Override the default hash function so that the auto updated fields will not be used to compare objects
